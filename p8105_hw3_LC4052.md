# Problem 1

## Import data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Variable names

The dataset includes1384617 observations and 15 variables, including
order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department.

There are 39123 distinct product ids and 39123. Departments contain
dairy eggs, produce, canned goods, beverages, deli, snacks, pantry,
frozen, meat seafood, household, bakery, personal care, dry goods pasta,
babies, missing, other, breakfast, international, alcohol, bulk, pets.

## Number of aisles

There are `r` aisles, and `r` are the most items ordered from.

## Plot of

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table)
